I want to add a data export option.  Specs:

- Component should be in the "Options" section at the top of the Wellness Page in its own drop down below Manual Data Entry

- Users should be able to export data and toggle these options:
    - summary (toggle on means include in the export)
        - time frame (user selects time frame - export data indicates selection)
    - trends chart(s) (toggle on means include charts below on the page maintaining metric selection and normalization state)
        - include values (toggle on means include chart(s) values in a csv persisting normalized state)


- Should export to pdf
