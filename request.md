We are implementing a medical records upload UI in the Wellness page.  Users will be able to upload files of type pdf, png, jpeg, and csv.  Juniper will be able to use these records to inform responses related to the user's health, activities, and lifestyle.

Please add and API call according to the MEDICAL_RECORDS_API_GUIDE.md
    - Use the /api/chat call as reference
    - Store files using Supabase file storage - use the image upload usage of supabase file storage as reference (app/lib/services/ImageStorageService.ts) - let me know what bucket name you choose
    - Max 8 files at a time, max 50 MB each

Please plan first.
