 Please review the wellness dashboard page implementation. There are sections for modifying values and upload records. There is a timeframe selection. There is a trend chart, which is the centerpiece which has all available trends that you can. You can toggle on and off. They're also supplementary charts. I've added about a dozen metrics so the current trench chart interface probably won't work. We can keep it as is and just use a drop-down list or we could do something else. Please come up with a few options for the new user interface. I'm considering ref factoring the whole thing and just creating a whole new one also considering keeping the current charts and just changing how we how they select metrics for the trans chart please tell me your ideas and if you have new UI options, please come up with a few of very complex complexity and tell me your recommendation note I'm actually looking for a minimal changes unless we come up with something that is just significantly better
